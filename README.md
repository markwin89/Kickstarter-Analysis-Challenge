### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The Countifs can be miscalculated if the lock key ($) is not in the formula for Outcomes Based on Goals. At first, I just had the cell without the $ and it caused the copy and paste to use the adjacent column in the formula.  I was able to review it and adjust. 
## Results
---
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The best outcome months are May and June but those months has the most outcomes compared to the other months. December is the worst month to launch possibly due to the holidays. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful Goal amounts are under $4999.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are small sample sizes for Outcomes Based on Goals that are higher than $25000 causing over and under projections of successful/failure rate. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Creating a Box Plot would determine any outliers that are in the sample size.
